# A strategy for search could include:
# - picking songs that have not already had search results in the playlist
# - trying to form a graph of songs that have been connected, and connecting songs that might not have otherwise been connected
# - choosing lots of songs if the playlist is similar, or only searching by 1-2 tracks if not
